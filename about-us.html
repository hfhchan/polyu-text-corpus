					David C. S. Li is professor and Head of the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, The Hong Kong
					Polytechnic University. He received his BA in English (Hong Kong), MA in Applied Linguistics (France),
					and PhD in Linguistics (Germany). He has published widely in multilingualism in Greater China, World
					Englishes, Hong Kong English, China English, bilingual education and language policy, bilingual interaction
					and code-switching (translanguaging), Cantonese as an additional language, and South Asian Hongkongers’
					needs for written Chinese. He speaks Cantonese, English and Mandarin fluently, is conversant in German and
					French, and is learning Japanese and Korean. More recent interests focus on the historical spread of written
					Chinese (Sinitic) and its use as a scripta franca until the early twentieth century in Sinographic East Asia
					(China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam).
