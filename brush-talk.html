                <br/>
                Using Classical and Literary Chinese as a Written Lingua Franca
                <br/>
                in Premodern East Asia
            </strong>

        <p>
            <strong>
                People in East Asia – today’s China, North and South Korea, Japan
                and Vietnam – speak very different languages.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Have you ever wondered…</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For over a thousand years till 1900s, how did people in premodern
                East Asia communicate when crossing borders for transactional purposes,
                <em>e.g.</em>, checking identities, asking for directions, buying and
                selling, or ordering food?
            </li>
            <li>
                What about interactional communication such as expressing opinions,
                debating controversial issues, asserting (dis)agreements, or even
                showcasing literary talents for the sheer pleasure of artistic
                appreciation?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Some highlights</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For over 1000 years, Classical and Literary Chinese functioned as a
                written lingua franca in cross-border communication in East Asia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sinitic</strong> <strong>brushtalk</strong> between Chinese,
                Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese literati was very common.
            </li>
            <li>
                The main purpose of <strong>Sinitic brushtalk</strong> may be
                transactional or interactional.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sinitic brushtalk</strong> allows for inter-ethnic, but also
                intra-ethnic communication<br>
                <em>e.g.</em> <strong>brushtalk</strong> between Wang Guohua王國華 and Jao Tsung-I饒宗頤:
                <br>

                As a written lingua franca and language contact phenomenon,
                <strong>Sinitic brushtalk</strong> is clearly under-researched
                linguistically and sociolinguistically.

            <em>from</em> G. Wang (2015: 50)<br/>
            ‘In my verbal exchange with Master Jao Tsung-I, language is our
            greatest communication barrier. My speech is coloured with Shandong
            accent, while Master Jao’s is Chaozhou-accented. Age difference is
            another factor, as Master Jao is older than me by one generation.
            Master Jao being a centenarian with erudite knowledge in Sinology, plus
            the huge gap in our vernaculars and scholarly insights, we often rely
            on <strong>brushtalk</strong> in our interaction. A booklet full of
            scribbles would often result after our in-depth ‘conversational’
            exchange. What is good about it is that plenty of precious materials
            are preserved for future reference.’ (our translation)

        <p>
            Between Vietnamese anticolonial leader Phan Bội Châu 潘佩珠, his Chinese
            contacts – reformist Liang Qichao 梁啓超 and revolutionary leader Sun
            Yat-sen孫逸仙, and Japanese leaders in 1905–1906
        </p>
        <p>
            “Here [in Japan] Phan Boi Chau sought out Liang Qichao, a refugee from
            the wrath of the Emperor Dowager, and has several extended discussions
            with him. Their common language was Chinese, but in written form, for
            while Phan Boi Chau was able to read and write Chinese his
            Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation was unintelligible to his interlocutor.
            They sat together at a table and passed back and forth to each other
            sheets covered with Chinese characters written with a brush.”

        </p>
        <p>
            “I found myself quite an object of interest; and as they set a great
            value on Chinese characters and compositions, whenever I went to the
            hall of reception many of them were sure to ask me to write on fans for
            them. The fans I inscribed during a month while we were at Yokohama
            could not be fewer than five hundred. The applications were, indeed,
            troublesome, and the writing took up much of my time, but it was
            difficult to decline acceding to their pressing requests.”

                What is the theoretical significance of Sinitic brushtalk?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Classical or literary Chinese was used as a written lingua franca
                in premodern East Asia – an age-old lingua-cultural practice
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “The welcoming of the visitors from Parhae 渤海 began with an exchange of
            Chinese poems between Sugawara no Michizane 菅原道真 and the other Japanese
            hosts and the dignitaries from Parhae. Only when Chinese poetry had
            been exchanged could formal negotiations begin. Depending on the
            availability of interpreters, it can easily be imagined that both
            parties might be compelled to depend on the writing brush as the sole
            means of conducting negotiations.” (Keaveney 2009:7)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Is the function of Chinese as a written lingua franca in East Asia
                unique or <em>sui generis</em>?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To our knowledge, no such function has been documented in other
            historically comparable regional lingua francas such as Latin or
            Arabic. Part of the explanation for the <em>sui generis</em> written
            lingua franca function of classical or literary Chinese may be found in
            the morpho-syllabic, non-alphabetic writing system.

            Learning difficulty? Two main linguistic differences
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Chinese – classical or modern, spoken or written – typologically an
                isolating language with verb-medial word order (i.e., SVO) and makes
                minimal use of morphology
            </li>
            <li>
                Japanese, like Korean: agglutinative, with verb-final SOV word order,
                and marks syntactic functions obligatorily with particles
            </li>
            <li>
                Sinograms being non-alphabetic, relationship between spelling and
                pronunciation oblique.
            </li>
            <li>
                All this adds up to “a seemingly insurmountable linguistic barrier”
                for Japanese students (Mizumura 2015: 107), conceivably for Korean
                students as well.

                Some evidence of grammatical functions of brushtalkers’ L1 mapped
                onto L2 (Classical Chinese) grammatical markers
            </li>
            <li>
                interrogative morpheme 何 (pīnyīn <em>hé</em>; Jap. なに<em>nani</em>;
                Kor: <em>ha</em>; Vietnamese: <em>hà/sao/nào/gì</em>; see examples (1)
                and (2)) and
            </li>
            <li>
                sentence-final question marker 耶 (pinyin <em>yé</em>; Jap. か<em>ka</em>;
                Kor. <em>ya</em>; see examples (2), (4), (6))
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Typological
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plenty of brush talk evidence shows that Classical Chinese became a
            productive and lively communicative resource with tremendous artistic
            meaning-making potential in the hands of creative literati, especially
            when poetic elements are involved in their spontaneous artistic
            improvisations. How is that possible?</li>
            <li>The borrowing constraints operate in such a way that (Field 2002):</li>
            <li>language with fusional morphology can borrow grammatical morphemes
            from agglutinating or isolating language;</li>
            <li>agglutinating language can borrow grammatical morphemes from
            isolating or agglutinating language, but not from fusional language</li>
            <li>By contrast, an isolating language cannot borrow morphemes from a
            fusional or agglutinating language.</li>
            <li>Field’s (2002) postulated hierarchies of borrowability is clearly
            supported by our Sinitic brush talk data.</li>
            <li>For over a thousand years until the dawn of the modern era, there is
            ample evidence of Sinitic borrowing, principally in the form of graphic
            borrowing (Hansell 2002), to the point of spawning indigenized
            sinograms (<em>e.g.</em>, Jap. wasei-kango 和製漢語; Viet. chữ nôm, the
            latter being written as 字喃 or 𡨸喃) that were unintelligible to Chinese
            literati in China.</li>
            <li>This shows clearly that agglutinative languages like Japanese and
            Korean can borrow from an isolated language like Chinese.</li>
            <li>But what about the borrowability of written Chinese into Vietnamese,
            another isolating language?</li>

            The greatest advantage of the Chinese script (...) is that it enabled
            literate people in premodern East Asia to communicate directly in the
            absence of a common spoken language. Chinese-style writing was the East
            Asian lingua franca, or we should rather say scripta franca, because
            unlike elites who wrote <em>and</em> conversed in Latin in medieval and
            early modern Europe, Chinese-style writing was written language, a
            grapholect.”
